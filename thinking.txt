We want to get the balance of a wallet on a particular blockchain.
What we know:
- the balance value should follow the longest chain
1. Get the maxHeightBlock
2. Look inside the utxo pool and find array of utxos owned by the given public key
3. compute the balance by adding all utxos in array  


Transactions implementation: 
a list of transactions are recorded in each block

Steps involved in creating a transaction
1. make sure the sender has enough funds, amount != 0
2. make sure the recipient exists - I don't think this exists on blockchain
3. figure out what combination of utxos should be burned to afford transfer
4. burn utxos, give transfer amount to recipient and return return change to sender in new utxo
5. add transfer to block

who is creating a transaction?: a wallet will initiate a transaction
the UTXOPool class will have a method that handles and validates
the transaction which is called by the blockchain class

when a wallet initiates a transfer, they can send the new transaction
to the blockchain as a pending transaction. When there are x transactions 
pending, they will be added to a new block and mined before being added to 
the blockchain.
